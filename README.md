# Bomberman Arcade Game
This 2-person project is an attempt to re-create the classic arcade game Bomberman. We used Pygame to develop the game. The game is currently in a playable state but we are still developing additional features for the game.


## How to play
The aim of this 2-player game is to kill your opponent before being killed. You can drop bombs that blow up and if your player collides with the explosion you are killed.

### Player 1
- [ Arrow Keys ] for movement
- [ Spacebar ] for bomb placement

### Player 2
- [ WASD ] for movement
- [ / ] for bomb placement
